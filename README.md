Materials for the Laus in Ecclesia course in Gregorian chant. Partitions pour la formation en chant grégorien Laus in Ecclesia.

# What is Laus in Ecclesia?

It is a course in Gregorian chant originally developed as a correspondance course by the Schola Saint-Grégoire of Le Mans (France) and modified in its present form by the monks of Triors (also in France). The English version was developed and is admininistered by the monks of Clear Creek in the state of Oklahoma, and the book has been translated into Polish as well (if not more languages unknown to me).

# What's the point here?

The course requires purchasing a book of Gregorian chant such as the kind used for singing the Mass regularly, namely the Graduale Romanum (of 1908 reprinted in 1961 or of 1974, for the traditional Latin Mass and for the Novus Ordo respectively) or the Liber Usualis (or a variant of it). Those are quite expensive for something which one might not wish to continue with at present, and further, they are a bit of a pain to use for the various exercises since the chants are taken from all over the book.

The scores are collated and reproduced in book form using Gregorio and LuaLaTeX. You can then print the book as you like, bound however you wish, to use by yourself or with students in the same way that university professors prepare course books with materials that would otherwise be assmbled on their own.

All of the scores needed for exercises and for listening but which are not in the book are reproduced.

Level 1 is provided. Level 2 will be added ASAP.

# NB

The exercise instructions are not reproduced, and you will need to make copies (all of Kyrie IX as printed, of other scores with just text and neumes spaced according to the directions). You also need to make your own tables etc.
